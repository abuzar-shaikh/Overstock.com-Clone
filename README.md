# Overstock.com-Clone
I have cloned a e-commarce application called Overstock.com It simply meant allowing to buy customers furnitures. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all.

In this Project, I have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like filtering the furnitures based on Price, offers, along with these I have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a furnitures and applying best available offers.

This is a Construct Week Project.
