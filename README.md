# Overstock.com-Clone
I have cloned a e-commarce application called Overstock.com It simply meant allowing to buy customers furnitures. Over time it has evolved to provide multiple benefits on one platform for all.

In this Project, We have tried to implement some of the functionalities of the application like filtering the furnitures based on Price, offers, along with these I have tried sorting functionalities and the User flow of booking a furnitures and applying best available offers.

This is a Construct Week Project.
